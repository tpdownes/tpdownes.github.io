# About Me

I'm a software engineer for the Google Cloud [HPC Toolkit][hpctk] based in
Chicago. The Toolkit is an open source tool that makes it easy to use Terraform,
Packer, and Ansible to provision custom HPC/AI/ML infrastructure in Google
Cloud following our best practices.

## Former lives

I joined Google in its Professional Services organization, focused on HPC
customers. Examples of my work include:

- a pipeline for a Life Sciences tech company that published golden data sets
  for use in batch and Kubernetes workloads
- a custom autoscaler for GKE that handled high rates of Spot preemption at the
  customer's extreme scale; a similar solution was later adopted by Google
  Kubernetes Engine

Before Google, I worked for [Univa] (acquired by Altair) where I led its
Professional Services team. We helped customers adopt [Navops Launch][launch]
to autoscale Univa Grid Engine clusters in the cloud with a focus on life
sciences.

At even higher [redshift], I managed a team of DevOps engineers at the [Center
for Gravitation, Cosmology, and Astrophysics](https://cgca.uwm.edu) supporting
the [LIGO experiment](https://www.ligo.org). LIGO observes black holes and
neutron stars through their impact on gravity rather than by light. We were
responsible for delivering computing services critical to the collaboration's
scientific objectives. Examples include:

* 6000 core computing cluster running [HTCondor][htcondor]
* [LIGO GitLab](https://git.ligo.org): managing our analysis libraries through
  proper continuous integration techniques. Over 1000 users migrated to this
  service, replacing a long list of duplicative (and older) services such as
  CVS, SVN, Jenkins.
* [GraceDB](https://gracedb.ligo.org). GraceDB is a web portal (on AWS) that
  coordinates near-real-time observations by partner observatories when the
  LIGO/Virgo network detects a gravitational wave event. In 2017, the LIGO/Virgo
  detection of a binary neutron star meger -- and follow-up by 50 observatories!
  -- was [Science Magazine's Breakthrough of the Year][sciencemag].
