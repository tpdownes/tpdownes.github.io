# About Me

I'm a high performance computing consultant for [Univa](https://www.univa.com)
based in Chicago. With Navops Launch, our Professional Services team helps
customers in wide-ranging domains (life sciences, oil/gas, EDA) manage
their compute and spend in the cloud so that they can focus on their research
objectives.

In a former life, I managed a team of DevOps engineers at the [Center for
Gravitation, Cosmology, and Astrophysics](https://cgca.uwm.edu) supporting the
[LIGO experiment](https://www.ligo.org). LIGO observes objects like black holes
and neutron stars through their impact on gravity rather than by light. We were
responsible for delivering computing services critical to the collaboration's
scientific objectives. Examples include:

* 6000 core computing cluster running HTCondor
* [LIGO GitLab](https://git.ligo.org): managing our analysis libraries through
  proper continuous integration techniques. Over 1000 users migrated to this
  service, replacing a long list of duplicative (and older) services such as
  CVS, SVN, Jenkins.
* [GraceDB](https://gracedb.ligo.org). GraceDB is a web portal (on AWS) that
  coordinates near-real-time observations by partner observatories when the
  LIGO/Virgo network detects a gravitational wave event. In 2017, the LIGO/Virgo
  detection of a binary neutron star meger -- and follow-up by 50 observatories!
  -- was [Science Magazine's Breakthrough of the Year](https://vis.sciencemag.org/breakthrough2017/).
