# About Me

I'm a high performance computing consultant for [Univa](https://www.univa.com)
based in Chicago. With Navops Launch 2.0, our Professional Services team
helps customers in wide-ranging domains (life sciences, oil/gas, EDA) manage
their compute and spend in the cloud so that they can focus on their research
objectives.

In a former life, I managed a team of computing experts at the [Center for
Gravitation, Cosmology, and Astrophysics](https://cgca.uwm.edu) supporting the
[LIGO experiment](https://www.ligo.org). LIGO observes objects in space through
their impact on gravity rather than by light. We were responsible for
delivering computing services critical to the collaboration's scientific
objectives including HTCondor computing clusters and [GraceDB](https://gracedb.ligo.org).
GraceDB is a web portal (on AWS) that coordinates near-real-time observations
by partner observatories when the LIGO/Virgo network detects a gravitational
wave event. In 2017, the LIGO/Virgo detection of a binary neutron star meger --
and follow-up by 50 observatories! -- was
[Science Magazine's Breakthrough of the Year](https://vis.sciencemag.org/breakthrough2017/).
